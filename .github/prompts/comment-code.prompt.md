Your goal is to comment the code.

Use technical english language for the comments if not otherwise specified.

# General comment requirements
- Identify methods without comment and comment them
- Try to understand what a method does
- Do not comment line by line, but rather comment on the method as a whole
- If you determine that a method is too complex comment inside method but always try to comment a bunch of lines of codes that does a common task

# Review existing comments
- If a method has a comment, review it and verify if the comment is still valid
- If the comment is not valid, update it
- if the comment is not good or is not exaustive enough, update it to be more descriptive
