# Game Engine Tests

This directory contains unit and integration tests for the adventure game engine.
Tests are written using Jest and TypeScript.

## Running Tests

1.  Make sure you are in the `game/app` directory.
2.  Ensure all development dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the tests using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

This command will execute all files ending with `.test.ts` within the `test` directory.
