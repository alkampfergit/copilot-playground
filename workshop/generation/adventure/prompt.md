You will create an html/javascript implementation of a classic textual
game like adventurlands of vic20. The player can choose a direction
to move, and the game will respond with a description of the new location. the player can interact with the game world by standard
action like look, take, use, etc. 

Starts creating a full adventure game, with a world map, items, and characters. You will first create the entire history, then you will breakdown the story into locations, place everything needed in each location.

Then create the javascript game engine, and the html page to host it.
The story should talk about vampires. All the game should be contained in a single html with javascript. If possible try to create a game that works with a concept of resources that describes the adventure, so the resources is a inline json object that describe the entire game.
